### Objective: Empowering Financial Decision-Making Through Data Visualization  

#### Key Point  
The client is seeking clarity on their financial habits, particularly for the month of November. They require a clear and comprehensive visualization of their spending patterns to better manage their savings and improve financial decision-making.  

#### Proposed Solution  
Develop a data-driven dashboard that provides actionable insights into the client‚Äôs monthly expenditures. The dashboard will include:  

- **Total Income and Expenditure**: A snapshot of the client‚Äôs financial balance for the month.  
- **Daily Spending Trends**: A breakdown of daily expenditures to identify patterns and anomalies.  
- **Major Spending Categories**: An analysis of where the client allocates the majority of their funds.  
- **Largest Expenses**: A detailed view of significant outlays to help prioritize budgeting adjustments.  

By delivering these insights, the dashboard will enable the client to make informed and strategic decisions to optimize their budget and savings.
